# Open-Pose-Live-Tracker-Multiple-Person-with-Visualization
This project uses MediaPipe's Pose solution to detect and visualize human body keypoints in real-time from a webcam feed. It processes the video frames to identify landmarks and draw connections between them, displaying the results with customized styling. The loop continues until the 'q' key is pressed.
This program can detect multiple person and can visualize in another pop-up window with black background visualization.
